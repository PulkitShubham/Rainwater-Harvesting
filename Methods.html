          <p class="para">
            The roof catchment method of rainwater harvesting is a technique
            used to collect and store rainwater from rooftops for various
            purposes, such as irrigation, domestic use, and recharging
            groundwater. The process involves capturing the rainwater that falls
            on the roof of a building and channeling it into storage tanks or
            other storage systems for later use. The roof catchment system
            typically includes a catchment area, which is the surface of the
            roof that collects the rainwater, gutters and downspouts, which are
            used to channel the rainwater from the roof to the storage tank, and
            a storage tank, which is used to store the collected rainwater.

          <p class="para">
            Surface runoff collection is a method of rainwater harvesting that
            involves capturing and storing rainwater as it runs off from roofs,
            pavements, and other impermeable surfaces. This method is effective
            in urban areas where there are limited natural surfaces for
            rainwater to infiltrate into the ground. The basic process involves
            directing rainwater from rooftops and other surfaces into gutters,
            downspouts, and pipes that lead to a storage tank or other storage
            system. The collected water can then be used for non-potable
            purposes such as irrigation, flushing toilets, and washing clothes.

          <p class="heading">In Ground Collection</p>
          <p class="para">
            In-ground collection is a method of rainwater harvesting that
            involves capturing and storing rainwater in underground storage
            tanks or cisterns. This method is particularly useful in areas with
            limited space for above-ground storage tanks or where aesthetics are
            a concern. The basic process involves directing rainwater from
            rooftops and other surfaces into a series of pipes that lead to an
            underground storage tank. The collected water can then be pumped out
            for non-potable uses such as irrigation, washing clothes, or
            flushing toilets. One advantage of in-ground collection is that it
            can be used to recharge groundwater by allowing the stored water to
            slowly infiltrate into the soil over time. This can help to
            replenish local aquifers and maintain natural water cycles.
