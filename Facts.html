        watering your garden plants. It has nitrate, a bio-available form of
        nitrogen, which is essential for plants to thrive and shine a bright
        green. Rainwater is also free from chemicals and salt, which can be
        harmful to plants.

        harvested rainwater has a shelf life of one week. To make it last
        longer, it will need to be purified through a filtration system. Once
        purified, it can last up to 6 months in the fridge

        <i class="fa-solid fa-lightbulb"></i> Rainwater harvesting was a common
        practice in the Roman Empire. Communities that did not have access to
        Roman aqueducts relied on rooftop reservoirs and cisterns for their
        water needs
